        <p> Fun Fact: I am completely new to the world of Information Systems. I just changed my major from General Business to Information Systems and Decision Sciences. I needed to specialize and find my niche. I was in the CIA program, but I decided to drop the program. However, I have not lost my passion for critical thinking, problem solving, and being a business professional. I am currently a student worker at a local nonprofit - the Knock Knock Children's Museum. I love it, but I really want to expand my repetoire. That is how I ended up in Information Systems and Decision Sciences. I want to learn as much as I possibly can while I am young to springboard my career. </p>
