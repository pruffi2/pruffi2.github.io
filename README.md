"# pruffi2.github.io." 
This is a very simple static website. I used a simple blog template and integrated it slightly with a gray sidebar. I am quite proud of what I have accomplished, but I can see that I have a long way to go. I have been working on this since the 8th. I will get it eventually, but I am definitely working and not giving up.
